A server for the PicelBoi Instant Messaging Protocol, a experimental and in-development instant messaging protocol.

## Name

The name "Minato" was taken from the protangonist's name in the manga version of Persona 3, Minato Arisato, as Minato means "harbor" or "port".\
**Note: We're not saying Minato Arisato is the actual protagonist's name. Makoto Yuki fits as well.**
